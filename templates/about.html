    <h1>Augmented Engineering</h1>
    <p class="intro">
        I believe the future of software belongs to engineers who can orchestrate AI agents 
        rather than just writing syntax. Here is how I build systems.

            <h3>🤖 The Agentic Workflow</h3>
            <p>
                I don't just write code; I build tools that write code. By utilizing 
                <strong>Rust</strong> for high-performance backends and <strong>Python</strong> 
                for AI interoperability, I create self-correcting systems (like the System Monitor 
                you see on this site).

            <p>
                I leverage Large Language Models not just for autocomplete, but for 
                <strong>Test Driven Development (TDD)</strong> generation and documentation 
                automation. This allows me to focus on high-level architecture while 
                ensuring 100% test coverage.

            <h3>🏗️ Simulation & Reality</h3>
            <p>
                With a background in Simulator Engineering, I understand the importance of 
                <strong>Synthetic Data</strong>. I use generative models to create robust 
                test environments that mimic edge-case production scenarios.
